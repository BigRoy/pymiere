# ![Pymiere logo](logo.png) Pymiere : Python for Premiere Pro
Use Python to interact with Adobe Premiere Pro. Gathered data, check and edit your projects.

## Why using Pymiere ?
Pymiere comes from a finding, has a Pipeline TD in a 3D/VFX studio, that we add no easy/good way to plug Premiere Pro into our workflow.   
Of course, if you want to programmatically create a Premiere file, you can simply create an XML file (see [Open Timeline IO & XML](https://opentimelineio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/adapters.html#final-cut-pro-xml)). **But** that require exporting and importing files, potentially loosing some data and no quick visual feedback.     
That's where Pymiere comes in handy :
> Want to check if some shots have new versions available ? Maybe automatically place them on a new track ?  
> Want to create tools for your editor using Qt, Shotgun API, custom libs... ?

## Installation
  1. Install the Pymiere Link extension for Premiere Pro.
      * Download `pymiere_link.zxp` from this repo
      * Install it using the [Adobe Extension Manager](https://www.adobe.com/exchange/em_download/) or the [Extension Manager Command Line tool](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/creativecloud/support/exman-com-line-tool.html)
      * To check that it is correctly installed, start Premiere, under `Window > Extensions` you should see `Pymiere Link` (clicking on it will do nothing)
  
  2. Install the Python lib
      * make sure the `requests` python lib is installed (`pip install requests`)
      * put the `pymiere` folder somewhere accessible to your Python
      
  3. Try running some basic code:
```python
import pymiere
print(pymiere.objects.app.isDocumentOpen())
```

## Documentation
### Quick start
Open or create a Premiere document containing a sequence with at least a clip. You can now execute the `demo.py` which will demonstrate some basic code. You can also look into the `pymiere/wrappers.py` file to see some more code example.   

Pymiere is at its core a wrapper for Adobe ExtendScript (Adobe flavored javascript for manipulating data in their software).   
Most of the help for ExtendScript will therefore apply to pymiere (see the usefull link section for that).    
`pymiere.objects` is our entry point to access all Premiere objects and functions. As pymiere offer code completion and type hint using modern IDE it is easy to navigate/use the objects. Some also have docstrings.    
If you want to know if Premiere Pro is running or start it, some functions are available in `pymiere/exe_utils.py`

### Versions
  * support Python 2 & 3   
  * Tested with **Adobe Premiere Pro version 13.0 (2019)** and version 11.0 (2017). I higly recommand the 2019 version because some functionality are not available in the previous versions. Should work for version 2017+ though.
  * Tested on Windows (10)

## Internal working
Here is how pymiere works :
1. `pymiere` converts the python action to some _ExtendScript_ code (ExtendScript is Abode flavored javascript used to access and manipulate programmatically their software)
2. `pymiere` sends the ExtendScript code to the `Pymiere Link` extension via the _requests_ lib (http)
3. `Pymiere Link` _node.js_ server receive the ExtendScript code and eval it within Premiere context
4. If some value is returned `Pymiere Link` will send back the _JSON encoded_ response to `pymiere`
5. `pymiere` will then decode the JSON data to have it back in the python context

On top of that Pymiere also include a mirror of all Premiere Pro ExtendScript objects in Python so that modern IDE are able to autocomplete and add hint while coding.
This objects mirrors were autogenerated from Extendscript objects reflection interface.

## Futur improvements
 - [ ] separate the generic part for communication between python and ExtendScript and the specific code for Premiere Pro, enabling use in other application (Photoshop, Encoder...)
 - [ ] add more examples & more _wrappers_ functions
 - [ ] add support for Premiere events
 - [ ] add more documentation, docstrings...
 - [ ] build one python mirror of ExtendScript objects by version, as each Premiere version adds new objects/functions/properties
 - [ ] add a way to simply customize a panel to call python functions
